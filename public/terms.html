  <div style="padding: 0.3em">
    <p>
      Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”).

      By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.
      Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your
      agreement with us if you use those Services.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Using our Services
    </h4>
    <p>
      You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.
      Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method
      other than the interface and the instructions that we provide.
      You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and
      regulations.
      We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are
      investigating suspected misconduct.
      Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content
      you access.
      You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted
      by law.
      These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure,
      or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.
      This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available.
      We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to
      display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean
      that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.
      In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and
      other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.
      Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and
      prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Modifying and Terminating our Services
    </h4>
    <p>
      We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we
      may suspend or stop a Service altogether.
      You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. We may also stop providing
      Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.
      We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a
      Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out
      of that Service.
